The goal of this project will be to create a landing page for shiba inus. I will make this landing page using HTML and CSS, more specifically using flexboses as these are everywhere on the internet, so I should become very profficient with them. 

My goal is to make a nice looking website that I can look back to in the future and say "aw that's where I started off"
